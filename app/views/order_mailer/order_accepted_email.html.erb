<b>Hello, <%= @order.user.name %>!</b>
<p>
  We are happy to inform you that your world trade order was accepted!
</p>
<p>
  Please remember that the gold should <b>always be sent in a parcel.</b><br />
  Sending gold via bank can make it very hard for us to identify the transfer!
</p>
<p>
  Please send <b><%= number_with_delimiter(@order.amount_from, delimiter: ' ') %></b> gold to <b>Gold Smuggler <%= @order.world_from.name %>.</b><br />
  Please note that it is enough to only put our character name in the label, you no longer have to specify the city name.<br />
  However, if you are unsure about it, you can put any city name in your label, for example "Thais".
</p>
<p>
  Once you have sent the parcel, please visit your <%= link_to 'order page', order_url(@order) %> and confirm it!
</p>
<p>
  When we receive your parcel, we will send <b><%= number_with_delimiter(@order.amount_to, delimiter: ' ') %></b> gold to <b><%= @order.character_to %>.</b>
</p>
<p>
  Yours,<br />
  Tibia Smuggler Team
