<b>Hello, <%= @order.user.name %>!</b>
<p>
  You have successfully ordered a world trade in our service. However, your order has to be verified by our staff first.<br />
  Once we accept your order, you will receive another email containing all necessary details, including the name<br />
  of our tool character on <%= @order.world_from.name %> to which you should then send a parcel with your gold.
</p>
<p>
  The details of your order can also be found <%= link_to 'here', order_url(@order) %>.<br />
  Please keep in mind that the name of our tool character will be hidden until the order is accepted by our staff.
</p>
<p>
  Verifying the order should not take longer than few hours (and can as well take just one minute).
</p>
<p>
  Yours,<br />
  Tibia Smuggler Team
