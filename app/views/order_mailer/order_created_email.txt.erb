Hello, <%= @order.user.name %>!

You have successfully ordered a world trade in our service. However, your order has to be verified by our staff first.
Once we accept your order, you will receive another email containing all necessary details, including the name
of our tool character on <%= @order.world_from.name %> to which you should then send a parcel with your gold.

The details of your order can also be found on our website. The link to your order is:
<%= order_url(@order) %>
Please keep in mind that the name of our tool character will be hidden until the order is accepted by our staff.

Verifying the order should not take longer than few hours (and can as well take just one minute).

Yours,
Tibia Smuggler Team
